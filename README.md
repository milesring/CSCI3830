#CSCI3830

Collection of Assignments from CSCI3830 Advanced Java at the Unversity of Nebraska at Omaha  
Fall 2017  
  
  
The assignments were fairly simple and undocumented, but contain Java EE development: EL, EJB, datasource usage, tags, etc.  
  
The class was focused around outdated software, such as Java 6 and Jboss server, so I developed with modern tools: Java 8, Wildfly 11 (for EJB), and Tomcat 9.
